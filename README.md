# <font size=8> :label: Recognize Anything & Tag2Text </font>

Official PyTorch Implementation of <a href="https://recognize-anything.github.io/">Recognize Anything: A Strong Image Tagging Model </a> and <a href="https://tag2text.github.io/">Tag2Text: Guiding Vision-Language Model via Image Tagging</a>.

- **Recognize Anything Model(RAM)** is an image tagging model, which can recognize any common category with high accuracy.
- **Tag2Text** is a vision-language model guided by tagging, which can support caption, retrieval and tagging.

Welcome to try our [RAM & Tag2Text web Demo! ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xinyu1205/Recognize_Anything-Tag2Text)

Both Tag2Text and RAM exihibit strong recognition ability. 
We have combined Tag2Text and RAM with localization models (Grounding-DINO and SAM) and developed a strong visual semantic analysis pipeline in the [Grounded-SAM](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything) project.

## :bulb: Highlight of RAM
RAM is a strong image tagging model, which can recognize any common category with high accuracy.
- **Strong and general.** RAM exhibits exceptional image tagging capabilities with powerful zero-shot generalization;
    - RAM showcases impressive zero-shot performance, significantly outperforming CLIP and BLIP.
    - RAM even surpasses the fully supervised manners (ML-Decoder).
    - RAM exhibits competitive performance with the Google tagging API.
- **Reproducible and affordable.** RAM requires Low reproduction cost with open-source and annotation-free dataset;
- **Flexible and versatile.** RAM offers remarkable flexibility, catering to various application scenarios.

RAM significantly improves the tagging ability based on the Tag2text framework.
- **Accuracy.** RAM utilizes a **data engine** to **generate** additional annotations and **clean** incorrect ones,  **higher accuracy** compared to Tag2Text.
- **Scope.** RAM upgrades the number of fixed tags from  3,400+ to **[6,400+](./data/ram_tag_list.txt)** (synonymous reduction to 4,500+ different semantic tags), covering **more valuable categories**.
  Moreover, RAM is equipped with **open-set capability**, feasible to recognize tags not seen during training

## :sunrise: Highlight of Tag2text
Tag2Text is an efficient and controllable vision-language model with tagging guidance.
- **Tagging.** Tag2Text recognizes **[3,400+](./data/tag_list.txt)** commonly human-used categories without manual annotations.
- **Captioning.** Tag2Text integrates **tags information** into text generation as the **guiding elements**, resulting in **more controllable and comprehensive descriptions**. 
- **Retrieval.** Tag2Text provides **tags** as **additional visible alignment indicators** for image-text retrieval.
